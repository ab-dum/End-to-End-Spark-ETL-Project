1. **Set up Azure Storage Connection:**
   - Ensure that the Azure Storage account is properly set up.
   - Verify that the `access_key` and `storage_account_name` are correctly configured.
   
2. **Configure Spark Session:**
   - Ensure that the Spark session is optimized with appropriate memory allocation and configuration.
   - Double-check the configuration for dynamic resource allocation (`spark.dynamicAllocation`).

3. **Fetch Coordinates:**
   - Implement the function `get_coordinates` to fetch the latitude and longitude of hotels using the OpenCage API.
   - Test if the OpenCage API is working correctly and the response data structure is parsed correctly.

4. **Process Hotels Data:**
   - Read the compressed CSV files for hotels data from Azure Storage using Spark.
   - Check for missing or null latitude and longitude values in the hotels dataset.
   - For hotels with missing coordinates, use `get_coordinates` to fetch their latitude and longitude.
   - Add functionality to update the hotels DataFrame with new coordinates where available.

5. **Generate Geohash:**
   - Ensure the `generate_geohash` function is working as expected.
   - Add a UDF to generate geohash values for the latitude and longitude columns in the hotels DataFrame.
   - Verify that geohash values are generated correctly for all rows.

6. **Weather Data:**
   - Read weather data stored in Parquet format from Azure Storage.
   - Test the partitioning logic for the weather data and ensure it performs well with the specified number of partitions (300).
   - Add a geohash column to the weather DataFrame using the same UDF as used for the hotels DataFrame.

7. **Data Join:**
   - Perform a left join between the hotels DataFrame and the weather DataFrame on the "Geohash" column.
   - Ensure the join is performed correctly, matching the corresponding weather data with the hotel data based on their geohash.

8. **Enrich Data and Save:**
   - Write the joined DataFrame (with enriched weather data) back to Azure Storage in Parquet format.
   - Ensure the data is partitioned by "wthr_date" to allow efficient querying.
   - Test that the data is written to the correct Azure Storage location with the proper partitioning.
